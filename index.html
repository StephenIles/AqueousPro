          <h3>100% Biodegradable Chemical Treatment</h3>
          <p>We have spent a lot of time and money on researching the best chemicals to use for
            our business and we want to try and do our bit for the planet.</p>

          <p>We felt we owed it to ourselves and our clients to try and find the best
          environmentally friendly products to use.</p>

          <p>We have found a supplier who can provide a product that is both good for cleaning
          and treatment, but won’t ruin the environment and is 100% biodegradable. It does
          cost a bit more than the rest of the products on the market, but we feel this is a must
          for us.</p>
