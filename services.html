          <h3>Pressure Washing</h3>
          <p>We have very powerful petrol pressure washers with all-associated equipment
            including lances, both turbo and standard nozzles and large surface cleaners. All this
            equipment allows us to tackle a lot of your dirt and grime jobs with pressure up to
            3000 psi.</p>

          <h3>Steam</h3>
          <p>As well as traditional high powered pressure washers, we have also added a “hot
            box” system to our equipment portfolio, which means we can produce steam up to
            140&deg;C at 2500 psi if required.</p>
            
            <p>This allows us to deliver steam under controlled high pressure, which in most cases,
            will clear all the dirt, grime and any growth, thus eliminating the requirement of any
            type of chemical treatment. It also has less water runoff due to the evaporation.
            This may not clear all stubborn dirt and growth but will remove most of it.
            Not all surfaces are suitable for a steam clean, but one of our technicians will be able
            to discuss the available options with you.</p>

            <p>Please ask us about our re-sanding service for block driveways.</p>

          <h3>Pure Water Cleaning for Windows, Solar Panels, Conservatories and Glass
            Roofs</h3>
          <p>We invested in Reverse Osmosis Pure Water Systems which are installed in our
            vehicles. Pure water technology allows us to clean your windows, solar panels,
            frames, soffits, facias and conservatories without using any harmful chemicals. The
            pure water produced, “clings” onto the dirt and washes it away. The addition of a hot
            water system allows us to remove stubborn dirt that maybe present on your glass
            and frames.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Windows, frames and sills are lightly scrubbed with a soft-headed brush.</p>

            <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Windows are rinsed with Pure Water (fed through the extendable poles), and
            left to dry.</p>

            <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Enjoy sparkling windows all year round, with a high presentation finish for
            everyone to see.</p>

            <p>Because the water we use has had all its impurities removed, the windows will dry
            naturally, leaving no smears or spots - just a pure shine every time. What’s more,
            they’ll stay cleaner for longer.</p>
            
            <p>This is delivered via WFP (water fed poles) by our technicians from the ground, if
            required we can go up to 7 floors using this type of technology. This eliminates the
            use of ladders which could potentially ruin lawns and any associated health and
            safety risks associated with their use.</p>

          <h3>Gutter Clearing and Cleaning</h3>

            leading the water away from your property and ultimately protecting your investment.
